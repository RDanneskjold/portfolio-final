            My name is Benjamin Tilghman. I recently completed Thinkful's full-stack, engineering immersion program Cohort 30. We learned JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node,
            Express, and PostgreSQL, creating projects along the way. As project manager for our final
            capstone, I successfully guided our agile team toward completion of our three-week project. With these skills, I've transitioned
            into C# and ASP.NET.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am a civic-minded individual who keeps involved in community organizations and activities. I enjoy spending 
            time with my son, Langston, improving my coding game, skiing, MOBAs, and poker. I enjoy learning about systems
            (from coding to government to games) and creating efficient improvements.

            <h4>YouTube Database [YTDB]</h4>
            <p>
              YouTube's search algorithm is largely based on a channel's traffic, which results in a stagnant list of suggestions. Furthermore,
              a consumer must rely on the channel creator's description of their content which is oftentimes inaccurate or nonsensical. YouTube
              Database provides search results with a preference for channels that have been rated or reviewed by our users. This allows anyone
              visiting the site to learn more about channels they might watch and dive deeper into a list of channels related to their interests.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was project manager for our five-person team and developed a significant amount of YTDB's UI using React, context, and handling
              API requests and responses to our backend, using Node.

            <h4>Bonjour!</h4>
            <p>
              Bonjour! is a mock language learning tool which uses the spaced repetition algorithm for quicker, tailored learning. The app is 
              built using React, Node and Postgres and is deployed via Heroku for the api and Zeit for the client. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This app was a two-person project, created during the Thinkful course. I created the backend using Node and Postgres, implementing 
              the spaced repetition algorithm with a singly linked list.

          PA Language Access Plan</a>
        <p>I cowrote the Language Access Plan (LAP) for the First Judicial District (FJD) of Pennsylvania
          with Deputy Court Administrator, Janet Fasy, and the Honorable Judge Ida Chen. Required by the
          federal government for agencies to receive federal funds, this project was the first LAP of any
          judicial district in the state of Pennsylvania. It set the standard by which other counties are
          measured. This took considerable research, writing, and project management skills to accomplish.

          Racism as Dehumanization: Get Your Hands Off My Damn Stomach</a>
        <p>This was written as part of a series of articles I wrote for an Asian American web publication in 2014-2015.
          Unfortunately, it is the only
          surviving sample of my work. The writing is raw and bit disjointed, though I believe the theme to be strong and
          consistent. Reading it again
          after so many years, I immediately see ways to polish the rough edges, but I am proud of my contributions.

        <p>Currently sitting at 20 pages, this draft is nearly complete. The theory is crafted, waiting on the difficult task

          cabal of

        <p>For the past five years, I have been an admin for the "Korean Adoptees" Facebook group which contains 4,200+
          members. Membership
          includes Korean adoptees from around the world, of all age ranges and experiences. Group membership is limited to

          only and content is restricted to topics related to adoption, such as birth family searches, advice on travel, and
